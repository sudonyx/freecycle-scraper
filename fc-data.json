The ratchet mechanism itself is fine, but the metal retaining plate will need re-screwing/bolting into the wood.&nbsp; As such one panel will only lie flat, until this is fixed. We unstapled some of the fabric on the rear to see what the issue was, so this is loose.\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENTS\r\n\r\nAs a sofa it's 820mm width x 1750mm length x 950mm height.&nbsp; When down flat as a bed it measures 1150mm width x 1750mm length x 400mm height.\r\n\r\nThe seat fabric is somewhat stained due to sticky-handed child and apple juice (no bodily fluids!).&nbsp; I'm sure this would steam, or fabric clean, out - or sling a throw over it.&nbsp; No pets, no smokers.\r\n\r\nThis cost us £200 less than a year ago, but given it needs a little work we're passing it on for freecycle.&nbsp; Ideal for someone that could fix it up.\r\n\r\nCollection only from Fieldend Road Streatham Vale SW16 5.&nbsp; Due to size this would need a van or larger car.\r\n",
